				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Posted on 02 November 2009 with Chef Patrick</p>
<p>On day one of the T.R.A.F.F.I.C. conference held in Brooklyn New York last week, I had the pleasure of spending some time with Michael and David Castello. Let me just tell you, in all sincerity, these guys are two of the nicest people I have ever met. I had a great time speaking with them and am happy I had the chance to do so.</p>
<p>For the few of you that have never heard of the Castello brothers, their collection of domain names speaks for itself. Their portfolio include names like PalmSprings.com, Nashville.com, Whisky.com, Cost.com, Daycare.com and many many more. Visit their about page on CCIN.com to read more.<br />
They were kind enough to do an interview with me. Now, just to prepare you for the video, I asked one somewhat edgy question. The question was; did you guys luck into the domain industry? Let me explain myself, because this is in no way shape or form how I feel at all. I have heard the following statement too many times, I wasnt lucky enough to have registered domain names ten years ago. I love what David says in the video, most people will not do something unless other people are already doing it. I know the vision and courage it takes to be first, because Ive done it in my prior real estate businesses.<br />
I apologize ahead of time for the video sound quality. Unfortunately there were not many private areas for us to do the interview. As you&#8217;ll hear in the background, the hotel staff was setting up for the welcoming party.</p>
<p>On a non-domain related subject, Michael and David were gracious enough to donate a piece of history to The National September 11 Memorial and Museum. This took place only hours before my meeting with them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-778" title="Michael Castello and David Castello - Castello Brothers" src="http://www.ccin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/imageViewer.jpg" alt="" width="227" height="191" />ST. LOUIS &#8211; Nov 8th, 2005</strong> &#8211;  As the sparring match between city dot-coms and traditional media continues to heat up, both sides seek new means to lure increasingly demanding advertisers. Brothers Michael and David Castello sat down with Associated Cities to discuss their rise and where the industry appears to be heading.</p>
<p><strong>Associated Cities: When did you purchase your first city site, how many do you now own and why&#8217;d you enter this space?</strong><br />
Michael Castello: Those of us who started in the early 1990s got the names for free. In 1997, we had to pay for those names when InterNIC was assumed by Network Solutions and they retroactI&#8217;vely started charging $100 per name for two years of registration.</p>
<p>Many of the name holders from the 1980s and early 1990s scoffed at the notion of paying for something that was always free. That led to the second big domain land grab in the summer of 1997 when all names that were not paid for were released again. We really scored big that year and our portfolio swelled. We currently have more than 1,000 domain names.</p>
<p>Many people pretty much thought of the early Web as a fad. I felt the Web should imitate the real world as technology improved. I have always believed in the &#8220;I want it and I want it now&#8221; philosophy. When I would sit in my New York City apartment with rain coming down for days on end, I would yearn for a way to escape to sunny Florida.</p>
<p>The Web seemed like the perfect tool to create that vacation portal at any time and any place. That is why we put so much emphasis on having our city sites have the look and feel of the location. It helps draw the visitor into wanting to go there on their next vacation. It seems to have worked.</p>
<p><strong>AC: PalmSprings.com has a different look and feel than many other city dot-coms. Please tell us about why you&#8217;ve opted against a more module-based design.</strong><br />
David Castello: I prefer to think of PalmSprings.com as more organic than modular. In a funny way, I&#8217;ve always compared it to the evolution of the Las Vegas strip. They started with one hotel and then built it up as the demand naturally increased. We didn&#8217;t start off saying: &#8220;Let&#8217;s launch PalmSprings.com by putting up 40 advertisers on the front page at $1,250 each a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>We started in early 1998 by signing hotels, restaurants and shops for $100 each a month. We&#8217;d write a page about them and then experiment with different ways of using PalmSprings.com&#8217;s inherent high traffic to generate revenue.</p>
<p>While some would stay at their $100-a-month listings, others called and asked: &#8220;How much to be on the front page?&#8221; At the time, we hadn&#8217;t ever thought about putting advertisers on the front page. Many of our clients &#8211; particularly those in hotels, real estate and golf &#8211; knew we were on to something. PalmSprings.com evolved and we evolved with it.</p>
<p><strong>AC: What does your competition have over you and what do you have over your competition?</strong><br />
DC: When it comes to Internet marketing, there is no competition in Palm Springs for PalmSprings.com. That&#8217;s because we&#8217;ve concentrated on generating revenue for our clients since day one. Revenue will always be the most important thing to advertisers. Everything else is just smoke and mirrors.</p>
<p>I began actI&#8217;vely signing businesses to PalmSprings.com in March 1998 and immediately came up against other reps pushing their Palm Springs area magazine, newspaper, radio and TV Web sites.</p>
<p>These reps would tell business owners: &#8220;We get 1 billion page impressions, 1 trillion unique visitors and the average viewer spends eight hours a day on our site.&#8221; They&#8217;d then hand them a four-color, glossy press kit. I didn&#8217;t have a press kit and would tell them: &#8220;We generated more than $10,000 last month for the business next door to you. Here&#8217;s the owner&#8217;s phone number. Call him.&#8221; I signed 88 businesses in the first 90 days.</p>
<p>MC: PalmSprings.com has no competition on the Internet. I consider our only competition to be traditional media. It has always been the go-to place for advertising dollars in the past. In the future, I believe that traditional media will be absorbed by Internet-based portals once local citizens feel comfortable using that media in large numbers.</p>
<p>We have no competition from 100 miles out of Palm Springs. You just can&#8217;t touch the reach and popularity of the PalmSprings.com brand. The local businesses that advertise on our site would agree. Some hotels would promote that their reservations are upward of 50 percent because of us. Print media just can&#8217;t boast those numbers for the price.</p>
<p><strong>AC: What do you love about the city dot-com space? What about it scares you?</strong><br />
MC: I love the fact that we are all starting to work together. I believe the Internet visitor is looking for specific information and is willing to buy into it. The more we offer similar functions, the more those visitors will feel comfortable going to us for their needs and their needs will grow. We want to help forge that relationship early.</p>
<p>I worry about whenever we start to move into someone else&#8217;s space that they will instinctI&#8217;vely try to fight to eliminate you from that stage. I do believe we need to move strategically forward and choose our fights sensibly. The more the city dot-com sites become relevant, the more we need to protect our interests. Associated Cities is a great model for us all coming together for common needs.</p>
<p>DC: Nothing about this business scares me. Before the Internet, my brother and I were in rock bands together. Ever play before a bar full of drunken bikers screaming for Lynyrd Skynyrd? Now That&#8217;s scary.</p>
<p><strong>AC: How will this space drastically change in five years?</strong><br />
MC: In my opinion, everything is going toward smaller, modular, wireless, hands free and heads up. Picture the guy next to you on the train looking through his heads-up sunglasses and making voice command reservations through his high-speed wireless phone/computer. The less buttons, the better.</p>
<p>DC: Regardless of where technology takes us, the public will always dictate longevity. It was the same with radio and television and it will be the same with the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>AC: What&#8217;s uniquely differentiating about PalmSprings.com?</strong><br />
MC: Though our front page is obnoxious with tons of local ads, we refuse to change it because it is a triple positI&#8217;ve.</p>
<p>Advertisers love to be there, visitors love to click on the special PalmSprings.com rates and we love the money we make from that page. Also, the site has lots and lots of static pages that all have a similar format. While it may take a lot more time to build, it pays off in many ways that can&#8217;t be explained here.</p>
<p>DC: In one word? Fun! PalmSprings.com is fun, colorful and deceptively simple. A lot of work went into making PalmSprings.com look that basic.</p>
<p><strong>AC: Aside from your business passion, what else in life fires you up?</strong><br />
MC: Traveling, skiing, hunting, boating, family and music (not in that order).</p>
<p>DC: My fiance (Natalie), my dog (cavalier King Charles spaniel, &#8220;Annie&#8221;), archaeology, cigars, travel (I love Italy), writing and lots of wine.</p>
<p><strong>AC: Down the road, what are your grand plans for PalmSprings.com?</strong><br />
MC: I personally would like to venture into more partnerships with local franchises. The idea of having PalmSprings.com partner with the city to create a free Wi-Fi cloud over the area is appealing to me.</p>
<p>DC: I tend to feel (rather than know) the next chapter for PalmSprings.com right before it happens. Like I said earlier, PalmSprings.com is more organic than modular and it has long started to take on a life of its own. All we can do is observe where it&#8217;s trying to grow and then quickly clear a path ahead for it.</p>
<p><strong>AC: Do you feel there&#8217;s confusion between your privately owned city site and your local government&#8217;s city site?</strong><br />
DC: There is no confusion. PalmSprings.com generates revenue for Palm Springs businesses and the local government city site promotes the mayor, city council, boards, commissions and departments. We both do our jobs quite effectI&#8217;vely.</p>
<p>MC: If there is confusion, I&#8217;m not sure that confusion is bad for either of us. The global visitor is getting what they are expecting. I always believed the entrepreneur could create something much more interesting, profitable and enduring than a bureaucracy ever could. Governments aren&#8217;t good at making money; they&#8217;re just good at spending it.</p>
<p><strong>AC: How have hurricanes affected your businesses?</strong><br />
MC: For us, Wilma would have been the hurricane to do damage to our WestPalmBeach.com area. What we found in respect to 9/11 and the 1997 hurricane of Acapulco is that those areas need us more in times of crises. The world tends to come to us after the bad newscasts have subsided and we lend a positI&#8217;ve view to what was and is good in the affected areas.</p>
<p>The local businesses have to pick up and keep moving. The minimal expense of Web city portal advertising is a great way for businesses to stay in front of those travelers. We only saw a one-week drop in statistics after 9/11. Travelers are resilient and want to keep exploring this world. It doesn&#8217;t take much to get them back out to the next adventure.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been involved with the ICANN Business Constituency for many years and, like you, was against the new gTLDs when first proposed. I could go on with reasons why I felt they were not needed and how ICANN has proceeded in approving them, but we now need to take a fresh look for our industry at large.</p>
<p>The new gTLDs are here, and I have resigned myself to them while seeing a silver-lining, which I believe is going to be very helpful to our industry.</p>
<p>In my opinion, domain names are the key to individual freedom and survival for the future Internet. For a small entry fee, domain name ownership gives an individual the ability to own his or her place in the virtual world.</p>
<p>When I was a recording artist, the one thing that would make or break my musical success was distribution. The ability to move music to the consumer was controlled by just a few companies. The Internet is likewise a global distribution network that everyone now has access to. Anyone can move an idea or product to any and all parts of the world. It is incredibly powerful and it allows single individuals to compete on a grand scale previously dominated by large telcos and corporations. It is my opinion that powerful Internet companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, and other &#8220;umbrella&#8221; corporations, have slowly shifted the perceptions of regular Internet users in regards to direct navigation in order to make domain names less crucial.</p>
<p>The URL is something we all own but is also held captive by those that produce browsers. In 1994, the natural impulse for me was to use the URL to navigate wherever I wanted to. I found colleges were online, and I could simply type Columbia.edu in the URL and their website would pop up in front of me. What power, what freedom, to steer my magic carpet ride wherever I wanted. It was still barren land and it needed individuals with a vision to help build it.</p>
<p>Knowing that replicating the real word into the virtual world would take time, I saw the impatience of the public and businesses which resulted in the Dot Com bubble. Since then, search engines have became very powerful because a user could always find a web page result while a web address did not always resolve to a working website.</p>
<p>After twenty years, almost every brand or keyword now has a viable, trusted website. The problem is that Google and Facebook have become the main way people navigate to these brands. The people of the virtual world bought into services provided by these walled gardens, giving Google, Facebook, and now the U.S. government, much more control of our navigation and information. I see a monopoly that in the past would have been regulated or broken up. I see what appears to be an alliance between the government and these companies that is benefiting them and in turn, controlling the web community. I believe this upends the scales of democracy.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve noticed:</p>
<p>For many years, Apple&#8217;s Safari browser directly defaulted to the dot com when someone typed a keyword into its address bar. Now, after Steve Jobs has passed on, Apple no longer directs keywords to dot com, and those same keywords redirect to search results and advertisers. Steve Jobs understood the opportunity that domain names offered everyone. At one point in the past few years, Google nearly removed the address bar entirely in their Chrome browser in favor of their search bar. They even asked ICANN to consider resolving DNS to just &#8220;keywords&#8221; (which would have rendered gTLDs unnecessary!). Thankfully, ICANN turned them down, saying it would break the DNS. Instead, Google moved its search bar right next to the address bar, and ultimately took control of the URL. Google was changing the way people used the Internet. Much like CompuServ and Prodigy in the 80s, the Internet is reverting to a series of &#8220;intranets” that are owned by large corporations. Individual freedoms and inherent rights are being trampled on. Where are the leaders &#8220;for the people&#8221; in the virtual world to bring balance?</p>
<p>What now are WE to do?</p>
<p>Domain names empower people. We could say domain names ARE people; they are that important. Everyone should have the opportunity to own a domain name and be unfettered in how they use it. Peer-to-peer (P2P) is liberty, but domain names now need protection from those entities which are diminishing their influence. The domain industry and the ICA have a unique opportunity to take this plight and forge a positive result.</p>
<p>Along with all of the ccTLDs, the new gTLDs make the domain name pyramid much bigger, which gives the domain industry a greater virtual signature. Everyone who promotes the domain industry is an &#8220;asset. The new gTLD registries will likely spend millions of dollars to make the public aware of the importance of domain names. They will be doing the heavy lifting, and the more the public talks about domain names, the better the balance between individual users and powerful corporations. We can coalesce to work together.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve suggested to the board of ICA an agreement to the &#8220;Understanding of Personal Empowerment&#8221; that I believe companies like Apple, Google and Facebook could agree with. It is in their best interests to show that they are helping domain names (i.e. individuals) and not trying to reduce their influence. Power from domain names IS power to the people. The timing is right for the domain industry and the ICA to work together to preserve direct navigation.</p>
<p>If we can&#8217;t agree on this protection, then I believe ICA should lobby Congress to put in place regulations that will protect domain name owners. We need numbers; those numbers are also voters. In the future, everyone will need a domain name. What we do now will help the future users of the Internet find greater mobility and advancement.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br />
Michael Castello</p>

<p>ST. LOUIS — As the sparring match between city dot-coms and traditional media continues to heat up, both sides seek new means to lure increasingly demanding advertisers. Brothers Michael and David Castello sat down with Associated Cities to discuss their rise and where the industry appears to be heading.</p>
<p><!--IMG SRC="http://web.archive.org/web/20101119164410/http://www.eprairie.com//news/img/f12940/costello.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT"--><strong>Associated Cities: When did you purchase your first city site, how many do you now own and why&#8217;d you enter this space?</strong><br />

<strong>David Castello:</strong> I prefer to think of PalmSprings.com as more organic than modular. In a funny way, I&#8217;ve always compared it to the evolution of the Las Vegas strip. They started with one hotel and then built it up as the demand naturally increased. We didn&#8217;t start off saying: &#8220;Let&#8217;s launch PalmSprings.com by putting up 40 advertisers on the front page at $1,250 each a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>We started in early 1998 by signing hotels, restaurants and shops for $100 each a month. We&#8217;d write a page about them and then experiment with different ways of using PalmSprings.com&#8217;s inherent high traffic to generate revenue.</p>
<p>While some would stay at their $100-a-month listings, others called and asked: &#8220;How much to be on the front page?&#8221; At the time, we hadn&#8217;t ever thought about putting advertisers on the front page. Many of our clients — particularly those in hotels, real estate and golf — knew we were on to something. PalmSprings.com evolved and we evolved with it.</p>
<p><strong>AC: What does your competition have over you and what do you have over your competition?</strong><br />
<strong>DC:</strong> When it comes to Internet marketing, there is no competition in Palm Springs for PalmSprings.com. That&#8217;s because we&#8217;ve concentrated on generating revenue for our clients since day one. Revenue will always be the most important thing to advertisers. Everything else is just smoke and mirrors.</p>
<p>I began actively signing businesses to PalmSprings.com in March 1998 and immediately came up against other reps pushing their Palm Springs area magazine, newspaper, radio and TV Web sites.</p>
<p>These reps would tell business owners: &#8220;We get 1 billion page impressions, 1 trillion unique visitors and the average viewer spends eight hours a day on our site.&#8221; They&#8217;d then hand them a four-color, glossy press kit. I didn&#8217;t have a press kit and would tell them: &#8220;We generated more than $10,000 last month for the business next door to you. Here&#8217;s the owner&#8217;s phone number. Call him.&#8221; I signed 88 businesses in the first 90 days.</p>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> PalmSprings.com has no competition on the Internet. I consider our only competition to be traditional media. It has always been the go-to place for advertising dollars in the past. In the future, I believe that traditional media will be absorbed by Internet-based portals once local citizens feel comfortable using that media in large numbers.</p>
<p>We have no competition from 100 miles out of Palm Springs. You just can&#8217;t touch the reach and popularity of the PalmSprings.com brand. The local businesses that advertise on our site would agree. Some hotels would promote that their reservations are upward of 50 percent because of us. Print media just can&#8217;t boast those numbers for the price.</p>
<p><strong>AC: What do you love about the city dot-com space? What about it scares you?</strong><br />
<strong>MC:</strong> I love the fact that we are all starting to work together. I believe the Internet visitor is looking for specific information and is willing to buy into it. The more we offer similar functions, the more those visitors will feel comfortable going to us for their needs and their needs will grow. We want to help forge that relationship early.</p>
<p>I worry about whenever we start to move into someone else&#8217;s space that they will instinctively try to fight to eliminate you from that stage. I do believe we need to move strategically forward and choose our fights sensibly. The more the city dot-com sites become relevant, the more we need to protect our interests. Associated Cities is a great model for us all coming together for common needs.</p>
<p><strong>DC:</strong> Nothing about this business scares me. Before the Internet, my brother and I were in rock bands together. Ever play before a bar full of drunken bikers screaming for Lynyrd Skynyrd? Now that&#8217;s scary.</p>
<p><strong>AC: How will this space drastically change in five years?</strong><br />
<strong>MC:</strong> In my opinion, everything is going toward smaller, modular, wireless, hands free and heads up. Picture the guy next to you on the train looking through his heads-up sunglasses and making voice command reservations through his high-speed wireless phone/computer. The less buttons, the better.</p>
<p><strong>DC:</strong> Regardless of where technology takes us, the public will always dictate longevity. It was the same with radio and television and it will be the same with the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>AC: What&#8217;s uniquely differentiating about PalmSprings.com?</strong><br />
<strong>MC:</strong> Though our front page is obnoxious with tons of local ads, we refuse to change it because it is a triple positive.</p>
<p>Advertisers love to be there, visitors love to click on the special PalmSprings.com rates and we love the money we make from that page. Also, the site has lots and lots of static pages that all have a similar format. While it may take a lot more time to build, it pays off in many ways that can&#8217;t be explained here.</p>
<p><strong>DC:</strong> In one word? Fun! PalmSprings.com is fun, colorful and deceptively simple. A lot of work went into making PalmSprings.com look that basic.</p>
<p><strong>AC: Aside from your business passion, what else in life fires you up?</strong><br />
<strong>MC:</strong> Traveling, skiing, hunting, boating, family and music (not in that order).</p>
<p><strong>DC:</strong> My fiancée (Natalie), my dog (cavalier King Charles spaniel, &#8220;Annie&#8221;), archaeology, cigars, travel (I love Italy), writing and lots of wine.</p>
<p><strong>AC: Down the road, what are your grand plans for PalmSprings.com?</strong><br />
<strong>MC:</strong> I personally would like to venture into more partnerships with local franchises. The idea of having PalmSprings.com partner with the city to create a free Wi-Fi cloud over the area is appealing to me.</p>
<p><strong>DC:</strong> I tend to feel (rather than know) the next chapter for PalmSprings.com right before it happens. Like I said earlier, PalmSprings.com is more organic than modular and it has long started to take on a life of its own. All we can do is observe where it&#8217;s trying to grow and then quickly clear a path ahead for it.</p>
<p><strong>AC: Do you feel there&#8217;s confusion between your privately owned city site and your local government&#8217;s city site?</strong><br />
<strong>DC:</strong> There is no confusion. PalmSprings.com generates revenue for Palm Springs businesses and the local government city site promotes the mayor, city council, boards, commissions and departments. We both do our jobs quite effectively.</p>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> If there is confusion, I&#8217;m not sure that confusion is bad for either of us. The global visitor is getting what they are expecting. I always believed the entrepreneur could create something much more interesting, profitable and enduring than a bureaucracy ever could. Governments aren&#8217;t good at making money; they&#8217;re just good at spending it.</p>
<p><strong>AC: How have hurricanes affected your businesses?</strong><br />
<strong>MC:</strong> For us, Wilma would have been the hurricane to do damage to our WestPalmBeach.com area. What we found in respect to 9/11 and the 1997 hurricane of Acapulco is that those areas need us more in times of crises. The world tends to come to us after the bad newscasts have subsided and we lend a positive view to what was and is good in the affected areas.</p>
<p>The local businesses have to pick up and keep moving. The minimal expense of Web city portal advertising is a great way for businesses to stay in front of those travelers. We only saw a one-week drop in statistics after 9/11. Travelers are resilient and want to keep exploring this world. It doesn&#8217;t take much to get them back out to the next adventure.</p></div>
